# Bring Home The Bacon

App to help job-seekers keep track of jobs they've applied to.

If you've been on market for a job, you know how annoying it can be to keep track of jobs you've applied for as well as where in the process you are for each particular app.

With Bring Home The Bacon, users can keep track of jobs they applied for in an organized list that they can keep up to date depending on the status of their application.

Once users log on they are greeted by a list of jobs they have applied for, separated into columns depending on where in the application process they are i.e. applied, interview scheduled, interviewed, offer received.

Users can add jobs to the list by filling out a form with detailed information:

    -company name
    -Description
    -Post Link
    -Salary
    -Location
    -If they've applied
    -If they've scheduled an interview
    -If they've interviewed
    -If they've received an offer
    -Comments about the jobs they want to remember
