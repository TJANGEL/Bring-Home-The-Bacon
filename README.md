# Bring Home The Bacon

App to help job-seekers keep track of jobs they've applied to.

If you've been on market for a job, you know how difficult it can be to keep track of jobs you've applied for as well as where in the process you are for each particular application.

With Bring Home The Bacon, users can keep track of jobs they applied for in an organized list that they can keep up to date depending on the status of their application.

Once users log on they are greeted by a list of jobs they have applied for.

Users can add jobs to the list by filling out a form with detailed information:

    -Company Name
    -Description
    -Job Post Link
    -Salary
    -Location
    -Job Status
    -Comments
